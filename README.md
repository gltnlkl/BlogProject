## The way to Versioning Blog App REST APIs
- Versioning through URI Path
One way to version a REST API is to include the version number in the URI path.
#### Examples:
1. http://www.example.com/api/1/products 
2. http://www.example.com/api/v1/products
- Versioning through query parameters
Another option for versioning a REST API is to include the version number as a query parameter.
#### Examples:
1. http://www.example.com/api/products?version=1 
2. http://www.example.com/api/products?version=2
- Versioning through custom headers
#### Examples:
1. http://www.example.com/api/1/products 
2. http://www.example.com/api/v1/products
- Versioning through content negotiation
REST APIs can also be versioned by providing custom headers with the version number included as an attribute. The main difference between this approach and the two previous ones is that it doesnâ€™t clutter the URI with versioning information.
#### Examples:
1. http://localhost:8080/api/products headers=[X-API-VERSION=1]
2. http://localhost:8080/api/products headers=[X-API-VERSION=2]
